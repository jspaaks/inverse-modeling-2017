# TODO items

- before Thursday, March 2, 09:00
   - send email to nlesc engineers for the course
- before Monday, March 6, 09:00
   - finalize syllabus, send to Bart (through email or DropBox).
      - reread Storn and Price, 1997
      - Most importantly, have some more content in the Differential Evolution
   - optional
       - review Gauss-Newton
       - review Levenberg-Marquardt
       - review derivation of slug injection Jacobian 
       - review linearization of slug injection
part, maybe also add DiffEvo with metropolis
- before Friday, March 10, 13:00 
   - prepare **lecture** differential evolution (maybe with metropolis)
   - go over the hand-out text with Bart's solutions
- before Tuesday, March 14, 17:00
   - plan appointment with Willem about his March 15 DREAM lecture (the next
day)
- before Wednesday, March 15, 9:00 
   - prepare **hands-on session** about adapting the linear model to the cubicmodel
(or any other model)
- before Friday, March 24, 13:00
   - prepare **presentation** about my HESS paper with Willem (serves as an example
for the students' presentations next class)

# Other

- Students are required to bring their own laptop with MATLAB 2013b installed.
Some preexisting knowledge about dynamic modeling is also required.
Enrolled students are expected to be present in the 7 classes 
(https://datanose.nl/#course%5B48757%5D)
- solutions: Bart's worked-out examples serve as a basis for what we hand out.
We make available the solutions as well as the text (Lotte takes care of this). 
- reading list
   - Tarantola
   - SCEM (systems modeling figure, genetic algorithm figure)
   - Misha's artikel (about calibrating the interception model to throughfall v
storage?)
   - Storn and Price 1997: Differential Evolution
   - Spaaks and Bouten 2013: HESS paper about model structure identification
- Glossary and 10 commandments
   - students contribute to a table of items, each of which consisting of:
      - glossary term (as found in the literature/reading list)
      - identifier for the person who wrote it
      - definition
      - sources
