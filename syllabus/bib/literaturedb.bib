	the efficiency of laboratory subsurface flow and transport experiments.
	The objective of this study was to present a comprehensive set of
	hydrologically relevant properties for a unique set of commercially
	available silica sands. Features of sands selected for characterization
	included high sphericity, high batch-to-batch consistency, Miller-similarity,
	and availability in large quantities. Samples of four different sand
	grades (12/20, 20/30, 30/40, and 40/50 sieve sizes) were characterized
	for physical properties, chemical composition, water retention, three-phase
	air-non-aqueous-phase liquid (NAPL)-water saturation-pressure relationships
	for water and a model NAPL, Soltrol 220, and saturated and unsaturated
	hydraulic conductivity. Properties common to all sand grades included
	high chemical purity and low organic matter content. Water retention
	curves featured well-defined air entry pressures and the Miller-similarity
	of the media was demonstrated for both static and dynamic properties.
	During water retention measurements, we determined that the common
	assumption of a uniform vertical water content distribution in retention
	cells can result in significant errors in uniform porous media. A
	numerical correction procedure was developed and successfully applied
	to correct fitted water retention curve parameters, illustrating
	that potential errors of up to 70% in volumetric water content are
	made without proper analysis. The characterization data for the four
	sand grades presented here should facilitate their use in a wide
	range of laboratory flow and transport studies.},
