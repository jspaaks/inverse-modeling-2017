Dear participant, welcome to the course on Inverse Modeling. The document you
have before you contains all of the exercises you will be making as part of the
course. There are two types of exercise, labeled differently:

\smallq{The exercises indicated by a black solid triangle are the core
exercises; most of these will be discussed in class. Any files needed for
completing the exercises can be found in the appropriate subdirectory of
`./exercises/'. As you can see, the exercises are numbered for
convenient referencing.}

\smallqo{The exercises indicated by an open triangle are optional exercises;
these, you can make if the topic has your specific interest or if you feel you
could use some more training, or just for fun!}

Feel free to ask any of us if something isn't clear. You are also encouraged to
discuss your results with the other participants. We hope you'll enjoy the
course!
