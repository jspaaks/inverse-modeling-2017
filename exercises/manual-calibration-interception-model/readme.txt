On day two, we dive into the interception model.

First, we do some manual calibration to establish reasonable bounds for the parameter space and to get some feel for the behaviour of the model.

Next, we check the setup by running DREAM using artificial data (i.e. we know the parameters).

We then go on to investigate the effect of making different subsets (based on time or system state), and calibrating to those data only.
